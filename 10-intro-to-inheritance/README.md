# Intro to Inheritance

Today we're going to chat briefly about inheritance in Ruby and how to extend class functionality using inheritance.


## SWBATs 

- Define inheritance
- Understand how inheritance is used in Ruby
- Work through an example of inheritance to see its use in action


## What is Inheritance? 

- Inheritance allows us to extend the functionality of one class into other classes. 

What does this mean? Let's break that down in plain English. 

--> Able to use certain objects/methods in another class. TRUEEEE 

--> Lets you modify or redefine methods from the base class to perform a specific function. ALSO TRUEEEEEEEE


- So inheritance allows us to take all of the goodness from one class and use it for other subclasses. How is this implemented in Ruby? 



## Understanding how inheritance is used in Ruby

- Often times in Ruby, we create hierarchical classes that need content from a previous class to run. Using inheritance keeps our code DRY and consistent.

- What are some implementations of inheritance in Ruby that you can think of? 

--> In the instance of people, we can give people from different areas different attributes.


## Using inheritance in an example

- Flip on over to `restaurant.rb` for to see a working example of inheritance.

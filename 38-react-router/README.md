# React Router

- [Documentation on Github](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Quick Guide](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)

### React Router Components

#### Router
Will use 1 place in our application (and one place only).
Very top level, essentially listening for when the route changes, and making that info accessible

#### Route
Conditionally render a certain component based on what the route looks like

#### Link
Changes the url we see in the browser, must have a 'to' prop

#### Switch
Pick one of the following routes (the first that matches), don't look at the others (like an if/ else if/ else if)

#### Redirect


### Benefits
- Faster (Client Side Routing)
- UI in sync with the URL (Dynamic Route Matching)
- Easy to implement navigation
- Still a SPA (Single Page Application)
